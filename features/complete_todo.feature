Feature: Complete my Todos
  In order to differentiate between things to do and things I've done
  As a user
  I should be able to complete my todos

  Scenario:
     Given I have signed in
     When I create a todo titled "Buy some milk"
     And I complete the todo "Buy some milk"
     Then "Buy some milk" should be marked completed
